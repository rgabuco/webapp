          <h2>Our Journey</h2>
          Established in 2024, Creative Studio Rentals was born out of a passion for providing flexible 
          and affordable spaces that cater to the unique needs of artists, filmmakers, photographers, and other creative professionals.

          <h2>Meet the Founders</h2>
          Our company was founded by a talented group of creatives—Rudy Gabuco, Jensen Castro, and Dawn Bosing—who shared a vision 
          of making high-quality studio spaces accessible to everyone in the creative community.
